# Fortiapp Cloud Functions

**This is just a POC**

## How to use

- Build image from `resources/project_boilerplate` with the name 'fortiapp-function-base:latest' or any name you want but you need to change it form `app.js`
- Configure redis in `app.js` or use any other storage but you need to modify the code where it uses Redis to store data.
- Run the command `npm start`
